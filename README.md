# MarketingPortfolio
Some of the advertising materials I've created. 

*Had little to no graphic design or marketing experience when hired*

## Rental Catalog
Catalog made in Adobe Indesign which contains most of the products available to rent.  Was given to many companies in digital and print formats throughout the midwest.  

*Note: PDF does not open correctly on github, file download required to see inside pages*

## Dewalt Advertisement
One page advertisement sent out in both digital and print formats.  I made many ads like this advertising a specific line of products or products from a specific supplier.

## Heater Sale
One of the first advertisements I made for this company
